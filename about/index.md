this site is both a place for me to talk about stuff at length that no one wants to hear me talk about & also a tribute to an era of the internet that i'm very nostalgic for. extremely simple html websites about extremely niche topics, my beloved

if you have thoughts about anything here, let me know! on the off chance that you aren't one of my 9 real life friends and you just stumbled across this, you can email me at radishfan13 (at) gmail (dot) com. if you're wondering why this page is semi-anonymous, it's because this site showing up in a search for my actual real name is maybe my worst nightmare.

best wishes!
