**ingredients**

- 1 12-oz bag of fresh cranberries
- around 2 cups of tart cherry juice + cranberry juice (the tart cherry is key. water can also work in place of cranberry juice)
- around 1 cup of brown sugar
- some cinnamon and allspice, but I actually rec keeping this pretty minimal or not putting it in at all
- orange or orange zest is nice, too

**instructures**

honestly I don't really know what's correct here I basically just boil it all together. the cranberries pop! it's fun. you can mush them or leave them pretty whole. add more liquid if you want or boil it down until it's pretty thick. I will eat this with basically everything for the entirety of nov + dec
