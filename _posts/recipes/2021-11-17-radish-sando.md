obviously I am a fan of radishes but I didn't really know how to actually eat them until very recently! this is my favorite way to eat them fresh. it is kind of magical! the egregious amount of butter and sprinkle of salt makes them not spicy, somehow

**ingreadietns**

- couple of radishes
- baguette
- butter (vegan butter also works)
- salt
- (optional) fresh greens, e.g. arugula

**making it**

slice radishes more or less thinly. toast the baguette, if you like. butter liberally (I really mean it. a lot of butter) + sprinkle with salt. put radishes and greens on. v good picnic food
