quarantine recipe inspired roughly by something I saw once in a youtube video but also I just made this one up

**ingredianets**

- dry cannellini beans (another white bean would probably work, too, but I haven't tried it) -- you could also just use canned beans and skip to the second part of the preparation
- a few cloves of garlic
- olive oil
- 1 lemon or other acid/vinegar
- spices: red pepper flakes, dried oregano, black pepper, whatever else you think would taste good
- also: some kind of jar

**preparation**

- Rinse dry beans and soak overnight (or at least for a few hours) in the fridge
- Pour beans + soaking water in a large pot and bring to a simmer
- Add aromatics: a few crushed cloves of a garlic, oregano, pepper flakes, etc. a bit of salt but not a lot -- salt at this stage will prevent the beans from getting tender. Taste the water as you cook to check the flavor
- Simmer until tender with the pot partially covered (if it gets low on liquid, add more or cover the pot completely)
- Add salt to taste once beans are tender
- Let cool in the pot
- (tbh at this point I will eat these beans straight like soup because I think they're delicious. but I'll set aside a chunk of them to marinate and eat on bread, with zucchini, on pasta, whatever. that's what the rest of this recipe is -- skip to this part if using canned beans)
- Very thinly slice half the lemon and cut slices into quarters. Thinly slice another few cloves of garlic.
- Mix lemon bits + garlic + the juice from the other half the lemon + more oregano and pepper in a generous few tablespoons or so of olive oil (enough to cover the beans you're going to marinate). Put this mixture + beans in the jar and stir/shake together
- Let sit in the fridge a day or so and the lemon will get tender and the whole mixture will be sour + garlic spicy + beany. I like it on a toasted english muffin with some arugula. I don't know how long it keeps -- I think I've had it in the fridge for maybe a week or two and it was fine.
