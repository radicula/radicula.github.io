I found a tube cake pan (the kind with the little feet) on the side of the road early in quarantine and thought it was a shame not to use it. I found [a recipe](https://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/best-angel-food-cake-recipe/) and removed as much of the sugar from it as I possibly could and the result is a (still sweet but not overwhelmingly so) fluffy eggy bread thing. use an electric beater!!! do not make life hard for yourself !!! it uses like a whole carton of eggs whites so I use the yolks to make custard to go on top. 10/10 i would make it more often if it did not take a whole carton of eggs

really good with cranberry sauce

**ingredients (cake)**

- 98 g flour
- 180 g sugar (normal sugar is fine but not big crystally organic sugar from trader joes bc it won't dissolve)
- 1/4 tsp salt (table salt is better than kosher because it's finer)
- 1.5 cups room temp egg whites (around 11 eggs; I rec cracking the eggs into a separate cup 1 at a time so if you mess up you don't ruin all of your other eggs)
- 1.5 tsp cream of tartar
- 1.5 tsp vanilla

**ingredients (custard)**

- egg yolks
- around 100 mL of milk for every yolk, although I've done a lower ratio and it's been fine. plant milk can work although may give a slightly weird texture & it will depend on what kind of milk you use
- 1-2 tbsp honey or sugar for every yolk, although this is to taste
- vanilla or other spices like cardamom if you like

**directions (cake)**

- Preheat oven to 375 F
- Sift flour, sugar, and salt together 5 times
- Whip egg whites at low speed until frothy (in BIG bowl)
- Add cream of tartar and vanilla
- Increase speed to medium and whip, adding sugar 1 tbsp at a time and giving time after each for the sugar to dissolve in
- Increase speed until medium-high until stiff peaks
- Fold flour mixture in, sifting as you do, 1/4 cup at a time
- Pour into ungreased tube pan
- Bake 28-30 min
- Turn cake upside down to cool for at least an hour

**directions (custard)**

- heat milk slowly, stirring and not allowing to boil
- whisk yolks & honey separately and gradually pour in the hot milk
- pour back into the pan and stir over low heat until an appropriate thickness
