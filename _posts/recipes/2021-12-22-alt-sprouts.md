I was bored of all of the flavors I'm used to cooking with so asked a friend for some new recipe ideas and she suggested [this](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/shaved-brussel-sprouts-with-whole-grain-mustard-sauce-from-vedge-restaurant-52537131) sprout recipe adapted from the restaurant vedge.
I've made it pretty close to that a few times but this is how I have been doing this lately:

### you will need

- brussels sprout
- toast
- mayo
- mustard
- soft boiled egg
- pomegranate molasses
- some kinda oil or something

### how to do it

soft boil your eggs now, if you haven't already. it takes like 10+ min including the water starting to boil so it's best to start with that (i leave my eggs in for about 6.5 min but it's not an exact science).
chop your brussels sprouts into little shreds. put them in a pan (cast iron is always the best choice imo) with some salt and pepper and butter or oil. stir so it cooks evenly. turn off the heat when it's a level of cooked that you like, but do the other prep while you're waiting.
toast your bread if you haven't done this (i butter both sides and put it in a cast iron, flipping when they start to burn. i always burn it (not on purpose)). 
spoon a little mayo and a little mustard into a cup or small bowl. mix them together. 
when the eggs are done, put them in the cup with the mayo + mustard and mush them up like egg salad. (my process for shelling a soft boiled egg is to put them in a cup of cold water and run the tap (cold) into the cup over the unshelled egg(s) while i peel the one egg at a time under the tap. keeps my fingers from burning on hot egg.)
okay, now is assembly: toast on plate, sprout bits on bread, egg mix over the top, pomegranate molasses drizzled over all that. some pepper can be good on top, too.

I've also done this with avocado instead of sprout shreds and it's very good! but this is supposed to be a sprouts recipe.
