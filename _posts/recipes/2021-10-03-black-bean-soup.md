this is maybe 90% of everything I have eaten in the past 3 years. this is mostly for my own easy reference (updated 2021-10-04)

## black bean soup

my mom's soup! one of the only things I was specifically and specially taught to cook; a comfort on any day. do not open a can of beans and then forget about it on the counter for three days

**ingredience**

- little bit of (olive) oil
- onion
- any other good soup veg (e.g. an old carrot)
- (optional) fresh greens
- (optional) garlic cloves
- 2+ cans black beans
- cumin
- cayenne
- oregano
- miso or another kind of broth or just salt
- (as topping) salsa verde or sour cream or cheese or lime juice

**to cook**

dice onion + soup veg into appropriate sizes and saut&#233; in a bit of oil. smash a few garlic cloves with the side of a knife and throw those in. when all the veg is starting to get translucent add a bunch of cumin (at least a few tbsps), however much cayenne you feel comfortable with in terms of spice, and a lil oregano. when veg is cooked, empty cans of beans into the pot (incl the bean fluid). if it needs more fluid to make it soup and not just beans, add water or broth. if the soup is still pretty bland, add more spices or scoop in a little miso paste. simmer until everything is warm and cooked; throw in some fresh greens just early enough that they wilt before serving. serve with some kind of topping, preferably something that adds a little sourness.
