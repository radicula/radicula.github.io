Nothing groundbreaking here, just my favorite way to make brussels sprouts:

- cut sprouts in half
- bit of oil in cast iron pan
- sprouts go cut side down on pan until dark (do not set off fire alarm even if it is very sensitive to even the smallest amount of smoke)
- shove sprouts around so u get browning on other sides. add kosher salt + pepper
- yum. maybe some lemon on top but honestly great just like this
