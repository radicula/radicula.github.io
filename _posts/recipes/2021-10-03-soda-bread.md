probably this is not very irish but one time I made this instead of going anywhere or doing anything on the fourth of july. it's adapted from a combo of a few different recipes I found on google dot com but mostly [this one](https://leitesculinaria.com/88052/recipes-irish-soda-bread.html)

**ingredients**

- 1 lb whole wheat flour
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 2 tsp baking soda (check that it's fresh by mixing it w a little acid and ensuring that it bubbles a lot)
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 cups yogurt (may need a little more) or a little over 1.5 cups buttermilk (make by mixing 1 tbsp acid for each cup of milk; non-dairy milk works too but not as well)
- couple handfuls dried cranberries and roughly chopped walnuts or other similar fillings

**how to make**

- preheat oven to 350 F
- lightly oil a baking sheet
- mix dry ingredients and fillings
- stir in yogurt until soft dough forms. if it's too dry, add a little more, but DO NOT OVERWORK
- place on baking sheet in a round. slash a deep X in the top
- bake 45-60 min
