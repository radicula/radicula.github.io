I forgot to keep an actual list of what I watched, etc. this month so this is basically just from the last week or so (I don't know why I can't remember any of the media I consumed before approx Dec 12th? it's just gone from my mind). 
Anyway, the theme this month (as with every month) is escapism -- shit's bad out there and sometimes u need to stop think.

## books

okay, you'll have to bear with me here because I've been re-reading all of the Tortall books and I have thoughts on them in chunks. 
The only one I have yet to read is the new Numair book, because it makes me nervous (I've never been a giant fan of Numair and it seems so different than her other stuff). I'm determined to actually read it this time! but I'm going in order of publication.

### song of the lioness quartet

This entire re-read was prompted by my learning about Tammy's tweet from 2019 that Alanna is something like genderfluid; this made me _deeply_ happy. 
I've always really enjoyed the way Alanna explores her gender and presentation over the years, and it's incredible to find that it's _deliberately_ queer rather than just stumbled into by accident. 
I also kind of love this experience of queerness that is experienced really only by Alanna herself: she is not proving or defining anything about her queerness to anyone (she doesn't need to! she just presents how she wants and feels how she feels) in the way that so many modern books about queerness are centered around.

I read a lot of books as a kid that were "woman does man things" and the Alanna books always stood out as something where, yes, it's "girl dresses up as a boy", but also she explores and enjoys and values femininity when she has the freedom to do so. 
Re-reading now, it's easy to read her discomfort with puberty as dysphoria; her jealousy of Thor's muscles and Thayet's beauty as gender envy each in their own ways. 
Her euphoria at finally being able to try wearing dresses but also at being a powerful knight; the way that, once she has the freedom to present however she wants she makes decisions that are counter expectations based on what makes her comfortable.
(In particular I'm thinking of the scene in Lioness Rampant where she cuts her hair short and everyone except George and Buri laments the loss -- George is a man who respects her desires to present however she wishes.)
Alanna, unlike Kel, does not have a distaff shield: Alanna is not a lady knight. She earned her knighthood as a man, and she is a knight without the qualifier.

Anyway, these books are not perfect by any measure: all of the Tortall books reek of some amount of white savior-ism, and this series in particular is very "chosen one" to an extent that's distracting. However, I still love them.

I first read the Alanna books as a kid -- probably much younger than I should have, honestly. I remember very distinctly reading the "womanhood" chapter of the first book while sitting in the back of Mormon church and holding the book open as narrowly as possible so that no one could read over my shoulder; I knew it wasn't church-appropriate (although I didn't really understand at 8 or 9 _why_ it was inappropriate). 
They were formative for me in many ways and it's always a pleasure to re-read them, despite their flaws.

### the immortals quartet

Daine was my favorite of the Tortall main characters as a kid, mostly because I really loved animals and really wanted to be able to talk to them. 
Since growing up a little, I've been less interested in this series. I don't think I've re-read it in about a decade. 
It's still less interesting to me than some of the others, but it holds up more than I remember. That said, the romance with Numair has always weirded me out (as Neal says, he's too old for her).

### protector of the small quartet

I _love_ Kel. I love having the privilege to be inside her head in a third person limited way -- if you only saw her through her speech and her facial expressions you'd lose so much.
I love the way Kel surrounds herself with family. I love the extended cast of this series. 
Neal is clever in a way that's so fun but also he's so tender -- I love Dom, too, and Raoul, and for all that the romance with Cleon makes me uncomfortable (it always felt forced to me, and even more so knowing that Kel realizes as she grows that she's aroace), he's also very sweet. Tobe! And oh my god Lalasa is incredible, too. And all of the ladies from the Yamani islands!
Every time I read this series I want more when it's over. It's really, really hard for me to put it down. I love Kel so, so much. I want to be more like her.

### tricksters duology

This is where I'm at in my re-read now -- I just finished Trickster's Choice. These are probably the most egregious of the Tortall books in terms of white savior-ness, 
and while I really do love Aly and Nawat and I enjoy that she is less "noble" than the other heroines, I'm finding it harder to get through this series than I did the others.
Part of it is maybe that these books are just a little heavier than the earlier series, and part of it is probably that I'm still partially stuck in Kel's head from reading PotS, but also part of it is that I've learned about the history of colonization in Indonesia since I first read these and
some parts of this read as ... not great in light of that. We'll see how I feel in Trickster's Queen.'

### and beyond

I always really loved the Beka Cooper books, but I haven't read them since learning about cops and flaws in systems of policing so ... we'll see how they read. I really loved Farmer Cape and Beka's relationship though when I read them back in the day. I'll keep y'all updated.

## movies

### spiderman (2002)

Like many people, I'm re-watching all the various spider-mans in preparation for watching the new MCU spider man (long way home?). I've seen most of them before, but not all of them, and mostly only once when I was little. Andrew Garfield is the spider man I'm most familiar with; I think he's pretty good, as far as things go, but Tobey is special in his own way. This movie is horrendous in a way that's incredible. 
In general though I really like spider mans because of how they're just some guy doing his best to help out his community! Spider man is a dude who would volunteer with local mutual aid efforts.

The hold that this movie had on society's collective consciousness for so long -- the upside down kiss?? the memes that have lasted two decades? this is culture right here. 
Wild, too, because that kiss is gross as hell.

## tv

### wheel of time (eps 3-6)

Okay, I'm still enjoying this (made even more fun by the conversations I have with my friend as I send her commentary. I was absolutely right about that one lady being TERF-y; I really enjoyed the queerness of ep 6; 
I am DEEPLY distracted every time Lan is on screen because his costume is SO good. It fits a perfect intersection between "this is just warm stuff wrapped around you" and "this is armor".
I didn't even know it was possible.

That said, WoT is making me even more disgruntled with the legacy of Game of Thrones.
It's great that the success of GoT means that shows like this -- sprawling fantasy adaptations -- get to be made, but god, I wish they didn't have to match GoT for violence. 
Something doesn't have to have spurting blood to be for adults! or just to be good! I feel strongly that TV-MA ratings are for being able to say fuck and for occasional nudity; gore is over (everyone take note!). (I'm avoiding watching the witcher season 2 for this reason. Season 1 was rough.)

### hilda

I rewatched this recently and (while I find some of the subplots with Hilda and her mom being incapable of communicating kind of repetitive and annoying), I have a tremendous weakness for "children's animated media about folklore" and so I love this series.
I'm looking forward to the special that's coming out at the end of the year!

## other stuff

### the lightning thief the musical

I .... loved this? It's my first time ever watching a bootleg, and I haven't really watched any musicals since I did stage crew in high school. But this adaptation is deeply charming and I hadn't realized how much I miss musicals as a medium.
I didn't mind at all that the cameraperson dropped the camera a few times.

## in conclusion

I will continue to speedrun Tamora Pierce's entire discograpy. Upcoming viewing plans include: the rest of the spider-mans, Terry Pratchett's Hogfather (traditional holiday viewing), Karate Kid, possibly season 2 of the Witcher. Maybe I'll catch up on Star Trek: Discovery, or even watch some of the post-Matt Smith Doctor Who.
There's also a new Spiritfarer update that I might play during my days off if I can get over my frustration with Elena's quests. Also, a few holiday specials: GBBO, QI, Hilda. 

Happy slightly belated solstice! Wishing you as much sunlight and joy as is reasonably possible.
