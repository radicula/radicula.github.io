title: i am a crow and collect shiny rocks (plates & bowls edition)

I've been on tiktok a lot recently (finally fixed my algorithm and it's giving me cats, mushrooms, and teens learning about fashion again) and there's this one person that bought boxes and boxes of antique glass. 
They've been slowly unpacking the pieces and giving some information about them, and every time it comes up in my fyp I think "oh hey! I have some glass I found on the side of the road. maybe I should look it up and see if it's old." 
Anyway, I did that on Monday and learned that the plates I've been eating off of for six months almost every day were (most likely) **uranium depression glass**.

Probably one of my most defining character traits is that I like to collect trash rather than buying actual things. 
I can't tell you how many times I've been talking in a group and mentioned thrifting or finding things secondhand and got the "ew gross why would you do that when you can get things new?" response, even in this day and age of depop and resellers. 
Anyway uh fuck that? we live in an era of hyperconumerism and in my view the best way to counter that is just to ... not consume. 
When I first moved to where I am now with just a suitcase and a duffle bag I had to get a bunch of stuff really quickly & cheaply, but now that I'm pretty well settled in I can really take my time to find and gather and collect things that are quality through random happenstance and thrifting. 
(I live in a neighborhood with a very active "free stuff in boxes on the side of the road" culture, so this is relatively easy for me.)

My point here is that, as the title says, I am a crow and collect shiny things that probably should be trash. Let me tell you about my hoard.

## uranium plates

I found these plates in a free box on the side of the road (this is telling of the kind of shit people in my neighborhood abandon, to be honest. it's generally a wealthy neighborhood and I reap the benefits). 
There were five plates, all made (I think) by Hocking Glass: two smaller (dessert?) plates in the ballerina cameo pattern (1930-1934), and three dinner plates in the roulette many windows pattern (1935-1939). 
All pale green, so I guess it shouldn't have been that surprising that when I found them listed on Etsy the seller said they tested positive for uranium.

As far as I can tell, the deal with uranium glass is that "it's probably pretty safe but [officially we can't recommend you eat off it](https://www.epa.gov/radtown/radioactivity-antiques)". 
So I'm probably not going to become the next spider man (depression glass man?) any time soon, but also after talking to my brother (chem major + enthusiast with a lot of niche knowledge about things like this) I decided that I probably shouldn't be using these plates for everyday meals anymore.
I don't really have the space or interest to keep a bunch of stuff I can't use, so I posted them in my local buy nothing group on facebook dot com and one person kindly helped identify the window pattern (which I had not succeeded at googling) and another person quickly claimed them. 
I hope they enjoy them and do not suffer from any radiation poisoning!

## restaurantware (diner plates)

Another side of the road find: two plates in this lovely pale blue ([Caribe Blue](https://www.ebay.com/itm/392847356209)). They have an incredible weight to them: exactly the type of plate you'd get a greasy spoon local diner. 

Anyway, and you'll notice that this will be a theme throughout this entire post, I broke one of them. Instead of shattering like normal china, it snapped cleanly in half -- easy cleanup, no dangerous shards.
This is obviously an incredibly practical feature to have for soemthing used at a restaurant, and the combination of the weight and the practicality of them makes me love these things.
I have some mugs that have that kind of diner-weight to them, too, and I almost always find myself reaching for those over the more delicate ceramic. 
It's kind of like having a fork or a spoon that has a good weight to it, I think. Very satisfying.

I also really love the gentle blue of these particular plates (the unbroken one of which is pretty much the only plate I'm using right now in the post-uranium glass era. I do have a few other plates but I don't like them very much and would like to replace them).
These's something very beautiful about how food looks on them.

## by appointment to his majesty the king of sweden

I have a genuine weakness for weird mugs. As one singular person who does, yes, drink a lot of tea, and also doesn't own any cups or glasses that aren't mugs, but still is only one person, I own at least fifteen mugs. Some of them I use to hold pens and things! but also I am almost incapable of walking into a thrift store and _not_ walking out with a mug, so my collection only continues to grow.

When I was in college, I had not yet developed this extensive mug collection on account of I was in college and didn't own much of anything beyond a few t shirts. But one day I went to the local goodwill and found this mug:

![king of sweden's mug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/142225586-a9702c9b-35c4-44ac-b829-19f798a7f96c.png)

which obviously I bought. Fun fact! For a brief period in high school my nickname was Sweden. I didn't look it up at this point, just enjoyed the mystery of owning an official mug from official royalty.
Later I went back to the same goodwill and found another one that was white.

I started carrying this mug around campus with me -- I've always been horrible at using water bottles because I'm bad at cleaning them, but a mug was easy and still let me get tea or water from the coffee bars without using something disposable. It became somewhat recognizable as my mug.

And, of course, I broke it. I think at first it was just the handle, but then maybe the rest of it, too? I don't really remember. Anyway, some combination of friends gifting new king of Sweden mugs to me + finding _more_ at that goodwill resulted in me having a king of Sweden mug for most of college. 
By the time I graduated I didn't have any unbroken ones left, but it was notable (if odd) part of my life for a few years.

Yeah so inevitably I just found two on the side of the road in my neighborhood several years later. And now I have more king of sweden mugs! One time I was drinking from one during a work call and my coworker said he'd had a similar experience and also has a king of Sweden mug, and was really surprised to see that someone else had one, too. 
This mug will follow me until I die, I think. Anyway, the theory is that these mugs were part of a Christmas gift package (with Gevalia coffee) as sometimes happens in countries with monarchies. This might explain how they're simultaneously rare and abundant.

Some other mugs in my collection:

Spock, Kirk, and McCoy used to beam in and out when you put hot or cold water in the mug, but I've used it so much at this point that it's kind of permanently somewhere in between (slightly faded).  

## bowls (a lament)

Recently I was putting away a clean bowl and somehow managed to drop almost all the bowls I own into the cat food dish. Absolute nightmare to clean up and also resulted in the shattering of the majority of my bowls: I'm down to two and one is too small for soups. Inconvenient and tragic to be sure, but the worst part was the loss of this one particular bowl. A gem among bowls: it was the perfect size and shape for rice with toppings (a top caliber meal), and had these beautiful translucent bits in it -- it's called rice gain porcelain ([read more about it here](https://gotheborg.com/glossary/ricegrain.shtml)). 
You'll be shocked to hear that I found this (incredible) bowl on the side of the road.

Anyway, it shattered with most of my other bowls (all IKEA or Target brands but in a nice variety of colors). It's maybe the saddest I've ever been over broken china; this is one piece that I might consider actually seeking out and paying decent money for a replacement. We'll see.

It's getting into the holiday season and that means gift-giving: my family is pretty committed to giving actual gifts, so we can't get away with just giving money or whatever, but also most of us are at points in our lives where we don't really need more random shit. 
As a result, we do a lot of asking "what do you want/need?" and then trying to answer in vague enough ways that you can still do something that's a little exciting (not just sending a specific link to a specific product) but also something that the recipient will actually enjoy.

I'm the worst at answering these questions because I legitimately really enjoy the chase: the serendipity of finding a sixth king of Sweden mug, the joy of discovering a beautiful plate on the side of the road. I want to curate a collection of bits and bobs that all have their own stories, not get a matching set of things all at once. 
So despite recently losing many of my plates and bowls, I probably won't ask for any for Christmas. 

As my grandma put it: "it's very difficult to shop for people who prefer to shop at thrift stores." Seems like a pretty good summary, to me.
