I consume a lot of queer media because I am queer media. I also have a deep passion for giving book recs: is there anything more satisfying than recommending a book to someone and them loving it? I don't think so.
I have friends who also want to consume queer media but are less "I will read everything very fast" than I am; I find it is my personal duty to read everything and give recs so that they only have to read the good stuff. So, here are my reviews of queer books I've read in the past month or so (in no particular order).

### _Maurice_ (E. M. Forster)

I think I've maybe talked about it on this site before, but _Maurice_ fundamentally frames my experience of pretty much all other happy queer fiction so I wanted to mention it here, again. E. M. Forster published _Maurice_ posthumously and the afterward in the version I read was heartbreaking:
deeply cynical, reflecting on how, in sixty years, while the actual novel _Maurice_ was closer to being published than in the 1910s, the UK was no closer to actually being accepting of men loving other men. 
E. M. Forster is more famous for his societal critique than his queer romance: whenever I read silly, fundamentally non-critical queer novels I want to (and do) criticize them for their lack of awareness of class and race, but also: do we not deserve to read and to write happy queer drivel? We have had to bear so many years of censorship -- should we not be allowed to make some things that are bad just for the sake of making them?

The actual novel _Maurice_ made me deeply sad. I know it is supposed to be a happy novel -- that's why it couldn't be published earlier -- but, to me, the kind of happy they achieve is powerfully tragic. I won't spoil it for you, but just know that this novel made me feel a great roil of emotions. 

I recommend _Maurice_ if you are interested in queer history or just enjoy the "dark academia" pre-WWI rich (white) men in college vibes. The 1980's Merchant-Ivory film starring Hugh Grant is very good.

### _Not Pounded By Anything_ and _Harriet Porber 2_ (Chuck Tingle)

Chuck Tingle is one of the greatest minds of our generation and his work is flawless. Highly recommend.

### _The City We Became_ (N. K. Jemisin)

The concept of _The City We Became_ is deeply fun and creepy and real and horrifying and hopeful in equal measure. I think I would probably have gotten even more from it if I'd ever been to New York. 

Recommend if you really, really enjoy social commentary with your horror/fantasy. And you like cities. The queerness is fundamental to many of the main characters and there is a mlm romantic element but that is not the focus of the novel.

### _Jane, Unlimited_ (Kristin Cashore)

Very very fun! This is a quick, light, genre-bending romp: it's kind of the perfect balance of "requires thinking" and "turn off your brain". The main character is bi and there is a wlw romance at the heart of the novel, but it's not the primary focus: highly recommend if you're just looking for a very good, very fun YA novel, but not if you're looking for anything romance-centric.

### _Ancillary Justice_ (Ann Leckie)

Questions fundamentally the concept of gender as a social construct: also, simultaneously, our socially-constructed concept of androngyny (Leckie uses "she" as an androgynous pronoun; we as readers could easily accept "they" or even "he" but "she" is much more difficult). It also explores sci-fi concepts of humanity and hivemind in ways that are different than other things I've read -- I very much enjoyed this book. Highly recommend if you enjoy high-concept sci fi in the grand tradition of LeGuin.

### _Captive Prince_ (C. S. Pacat)

I'd seen _Captive Prince_ recommended all over BookTok alongside things like _Red, White, and Royal Blue_ so I thought it would be another YA mlm romance, just fantasy instead of whatever RWRB is. I was wrong !!!! This book has almost no plot and pretty clearly exists just for the sake of being dub-con mlm erotica. (The fact that it originated as a story on LiveJournal supports this.) No shame if that's what you're into or anything, but imo this book should **not** be being advertised to children (teens) alongside books that are actually written for children (teens). To be perfectly frank I think it's probably even fine if teens read it! God knows I read worse on AO3 as a teen. But I think if you are about to read dub-con erotica you should know that you are about to read dub-con erotica, so I think it's irresponsible and pretty confusing that this book has gotten lumped in with other, much more tame, mlm romance. Recommend if you enjoy reading mlm dub-con erotica.

### _Carry On_ & sequels (Rainbow Rowell)

I think that this series is extremely interesting for the space it occupies in the genre of "this is fanfiction but this is also a published novel". I've noticed more and more books that seem to be trying to appeal to the fundamental appeals of fanfiction: character and romance-driven, playing with established tropes, kinky/explicit/funky porn, etc. Books that you'd know exactly how they'd be tagged on AO3. Some of these actually are or were fanfiction; I don't think there's anything fundamentally wrong with fanfic being altered and published as mainstream fiction. However, I find that many of these books (things along the lines of _Captive Prince_ or _Serpent and Dove_ or even _Boyfriend Material_, which I'll discuss in a bit) _only_ do the "appeal to the same appeals as fanfic" thing. I think, to be really good and be able to stand on its own as a novel outside of the realm of transformative works, you need to also consider the **context and ethics** of those things you're depicting.

_Captive Prince_ doesn't do this, it's just dub-con porn without discussion of the ethics and implications of the existence of sexual slavery. The world of _Carry On_ **absolutely does do this**. It takes the fundamental appeals of Draco/Harry: enemies to lovers, a dark past and a golden boy hero, teen angst, magic, whatever -- and places them in a world that has considered very deeply the context and ethics of drarry in the Harry Potter world and said, "okay, we can fix this." Draco is no longer an actual magical Nazi but just mean and a snob. Dumbledore and the Dursleys' treatment of Harry is actually treated as bad and abusive as it actually is rather than being brushed over or forgiven on some flimsy basis of neoliberalism. _Carry On_ to me is the absolute perfect example of something that takes fanfiction and turns it into a real novel that includes the world-building and consideration that fanfic doesn't need to include because it is derivative work.

In terms of reading the actual books without thinking deeply about this context: I think they're pretty solid. I'd rec them if you liked Harry Potter back in the day but now feel a little nauseous reflecting on it, or if you like drarry, or if you just like magic school YA. It's fun.

### _The Queer Principles of Kit Webb_ (Cat Sebastian)

A fun period heist novel with a mlm romance. Read if you like that kind of thing! Not period in an Austen-y, way, mind. Much less repressed and more fun than that.

### _Boyfriend Material_ (Alexis Hall)

I liked the romance in _Boyfriend Material_. I liked that Hall skipped "our relationship is based on a lie" and went directly into "mutually beneficial fake dating" -- personally, not a fan of the kind of miscommunication tropes that the former usually leads to. I also liked that the characters (both of them!) had to grow and learn to deal with their own shit in order to make the relationship work; going in, you expect it to be more "one messy boy and one perfect boy" but they're
both messy in their own ways. I thought it felt very earnest and pretty real; the actual relationship itself didn't feel super contrived even if the motivation for the fake dating was.

That said, the way that Hall pokes fun at rich (white) people while _all of the main characters_ **are** rich (white) people is ... really something. The novel is full of this snarky commentary about the "aristocracy" and wealth but also, even the main character himself is rich -- just rich in a "my parents are rock stars" kind of way rather than a "my parents are literally nobility" kind of way. It's a little eerie. But, you know -- E. M. Forster got to do social criticism but not silly, happy, gay romance, so now I guess Alexis Hall can do silly, happy, gay romance with social criticism to balance the scales. 
Read if you like silly, happy, gay YA romance with a side of angst, and can restrain yourself from screaming "get a fucking therapist!!!" every three pages. 

### _Red, White, and Royal Blue_ (Casey McQuiston)

I re-read this book recently -- the first time I read it was April 2020. Yeah, that was a mistake lmao. _Red, White, and Royal Blue_ was fucking painful to read during almost the exact time it was, in theory, taking place. Henry and Alex jet-setting across the Atlantic in the middle of a pandemic ... Biden's campaign vs. the one in the novel ... Henry dealing with the British monarchy right after Megan Markle said "I'm out". It was surreal, and weird, and I didn't enjoy it.

Re-reading it now, it's a little less viscerally horrifying, but the fundamental wish-fulfillment-y concept of an alternate 2016 is still something that I struggle with. I think the romance is cute. I think it's worth reading if you like contemporary gay YA romance (you'll get recommended it so many times anyway you'll have to give in eventually); it causes me some pain to even think about it but also I did read it twice. 
I think Casey McQuiston is a good writer, just has concepts that are perhaps a little too concept-y for me.

### _Heartstopper_ (Alice Oseman)

Achingly cute mlm graphic novel/webtoon series that is about to be on Netflix. Read if you like achingly cute mlm teen romance.

### _The Watchmaker of Filigree Street_ (Natasha Pulley)

Fun concept: clockwork magic, something akin to time travel?, a very tender mlm romance. It's 1800's, I think -- UK and some Japan. I couldn't tell when it leaned "orientalism" whether it was just for the sake of the time period or because Pulley was actually leaning "orientalism"; it didn't ruin the experience for me but it did make me raise an eyebrow once or twice. It's complex in a way that I enjoy but some people might not; there's also one character who is probably unnecessarily shitty. Recommend if you enjoy adult novels that are a little hard to keep track of, sometimes, but overall kind of a magical experience. (I enjoyed it.)

### _So This Is Ever After_ (F. T. Lukens)

Or, the gay D&D book. It's on the contrived side and I felt that the characters were about as deep/shallow as you would expect for D&D characters that were made for a kind of silly campaign. I didn't really enjoy the romance: the romantic interest is established on both sides from the very beginning, which personally I find unexciting. It's the "slowly developing feelings" part of a romance that I enjoy reading. Read if you like silly D&D books and also really enjoy extremely dumbass dumbasses pining.

### _In Deeper Waters_ (also F. T. Lukens)

I thought that the narrative in _In Deeper Waters_ was stronger than that of _So This is Ever After_, although the tone of it is more angsty/dramatic than the more comedic _So This is Ever After_. It's fundamentally a retelling of the little mermaid, but gayer and with more plot. Read if you like gay romance that isn't quite gay pirates but is close to being gay pirates (gay mermaid).

### _Meet Cute Diary_ (Emery Lee)

The concept of this seemed promising -- I'd like to read more fiction that's not just happy and gay but also happy and trans or just in general more broadly happy and queer (this particular batch, you might notice, is pretty mlm-heavy). However, the main character is just so deeply infuriating that this book was almost unreadable. To be honest it's probably accurate to being kind of a shitty teen but god, I have zero desire to be inside the head of a shitty teen. Deeply painful to read. Recommend only if you are a much more patient person than I am, or you are very very desperate for a cool love interest who uses neopronouns.

### _Elatsoe_ (Darcie Little Badger)

_Elatsoe_ is a bit of an outlier on this list because the queer aspect of it (the main character is ace) is nowhere near a central part of the story. However, I really loved it and it is, fundamentally, a queer book, so I wanted to include it. In theory _Elatsoe_ is a middle grade/YA novel, but the ways that it handles ghosts and colonization and folklore were so deeply real to me that it freaked me out way more than almost anything I've read in ages. This shit hits hard! Very good. Highly recommend if you like reading books.

### _The Prince and the Dressmaker_ (Jen Wang)

Incredibly sweet graphic novel with a GNC(/genderfluid?) main character. The art is lovely and the fashion is gorgeous -- highly recommend.

### _All Systems Red_ (Martha Wells)

_All Systems Red_ is the start of the _MurderBot Diaries_, which have swept across all kinds of SFF awards for years now. I've been meaning to read them for ages and I'm definitely excited/intrigued by this novella as a starting point. (We stan a main character who uses it/its pronouns.) Recommend if you like high concept, found-family-ish? sci fi, or if you're interested in the POV of a character who is deeply horrified by almost every social convention that exists (I found it pretty relatable).

### _Master of One_ (Jaida Jones and Danielle Bennett)

Very YA fantasy: monarchy, evil queen, blood magic, fae, collecting the dragonballs in order to help the Resistance, etc. There's a central mlm romance and a trans character, although she's not important until the very end -- I think probably she'll be more of a main character in the sequels. There is also some (unexpected), abstract, non-graphic monsterfucking that passes the Harkness test. I didn't like, love it, but if you were looking for some dark YA fantasy with some queer rep this would fit that bill.

### Ongoing reads (things I am partway through and/or have on hold and expect to read soon)

- She Who Became the Sun
- Raven Tower
- When the Moon Was Ours
- Wendy, Darling
- A Memory Called Empire (no idea if this technically queer, tbh, but I feel like fundamentally having a man in your head as a woman is kind of a queer experience? idk. I'm like halfway through and really enjoying it either way)

### P.S.

You might be saying, "hey, you're into queer media? how does this _not_ include the biggest piece of queer media of the moment: gay pirate show???". 
You're right to ask. The answer is that I am bad at watching TV because it makes me anxious.
Yes, gay pirate show gives me Anxiety, yes, it is deeply embarrassing. I watched four episodes and liked them but had to stop for my 
Mental Health. Sorry!!!! I will read a book any time but I cannot watch a 30 min TV episode right now !!! That's just how it is okay!!!!!!!
Leave me alone !!!!!
