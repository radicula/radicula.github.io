## books!

When I left you last I was re-reading all of the Tortall books. I finished my re-read! 

### The Tricksters duology

Out of all the Tortall books, these are the ones I read the least as a kid -- I've probably only read them ~3 times total. 
I always liked that Aly is different from the other heroines because she's clever and sneaky rather than headstrong and righteous. 
Re-reading it now -- frankly, some of the "extremely clever" things that Aly says and does read as not actually that clever, and the entire plot absolutely reeks of white saviorism. 
The whole concept of "we need to work with our colonizers rather than overthrowing them" is ... interesting. Especially as a primary theme in a YA series.
I do like Nawat, but I like crows generally. 

Anyway, this was the Tortall series that held up the least for me. Not surprising, though, considering I have less nostalgia for it.

### Provosts Dogs (Beka Cooper)

This was the series that I was most scared to re-read, because I loved them in high school and I have since developed a much greater skepticism of police. 
I have some complicated thoughts about how it depicts the Dogs as a police force -- violence seems to be their primary form of justice, but also there seems to be internal concern about this; 
Beka is regularly disgusted by Dogs that make assumptions about Lower City folk and inflict violence on them by default. That said, she also "hobbles" a lot of people with her baton without thinking much of it.

Anyway, I tried not to think to hard about this in my re-read and just tried to enjoy the story and nostalgia as much as I could. I still really like Beka's books.
I like that they're fundamentally just her telling her stories and that there isn't a larger overarching plot across the trilogy apart from her character development. 
Each story is sprawling in its own way but ends tidily (which I like).

My favorite by far is Mastiff. (Spoilers follow, so be warned.) 
I know that a lot of Tortall fans hate it, because it leaves behind many of the beloved characters from the first two books, introduces new characters out of (seemingly) nowhere, and has _that_ ending.
Personally, I was okay with the ending -- don't have strong opinions about it, tbh -- and I absolutely adore Farmer Cape.
Like with George, he isn't aggressive and doesn't have this need to prove he is A Man or anything like that. He is just trying to do his best with the skills he has.
And, I **love** that he embroiders. I want to be as good at embroidery as Farmer Cape is.
I also like the way that Beka and Farmer just kind of stumble into their relationship; to me, it is sweet. I could see it being jarring, though, especially if you were invested in Rosto (which I was not).
I also just like the pacing and tone of the whole book. It feels good to read! That's what's really important here.

### Tempests and Slaughter

I was very nervous to read this book -- I've never been a huge fan of Numair, and I'm always nervous of direct prequels. Having read it, I feel pretty ... meh about it. 
Not negative, sure, but also not positive. It feels a little like TP is trying to what she did with Alanna and Kel where she showed an afab person growing up and very frankly portraying puberty, but for an amab person.
I think that's fine, but I'm at a point in my life where reading about 13 year olds going through puberty isn't really interesting to me (outside of nostalgic childhood material). 
I also didn't feel like the book had any real plot. It was just kind of Arram being told what to do; Alanna and Kel have similar novels, where they are basically just kids in school, but both Alanna and Kel do a lot of individual goal setting and have achievements that mark the end of each book. 
Arram doesn't really have that; he's just being dragged around by his instructors. In some ways it's nice to have a narrative where (by and large) adults are actually supportive and helpful, but it was also kind of boring to read.

I also think that the fact that almost _every single character_ is someone who appears in the other books is pretty grating. I want some more mystery over how these people are going to end up! Please, give me a few main characters who aren't in Daine's series.
One of my friends read this book without having read more than one or two other Tortall books and I suspect that that's a better way to experience it.

Related to the fact that it doesn't really have a plot, this book feels very aggressively like the first in a series. I think it's likely that the following books will be more interesting; I'm just kind of tired of books that only exist as part of a series and not as their own books.
That's more a critique of the publishing industry than the actual book, though.

### Iron Widow

Very fun! I like that the characters are angry and that morality just doesn't really apply. I like the poly relationship. I wish bsands would figure this out with Kaladin and Shallan and Adolin.

### the sequel series to Percy Jackson (Heroes of Olympus)

Okay so I have like 45 min left of the Blood of Olympus audiobook so I'm not quite done but I've been slowly making my way through this over the past few weeks. They're bad! 
Also comforting in their own way. I hate how all of the characters only have 2 traits and also are immediately paired up with someone. 
There's no intrigue! no tension. This is a series where the fan material is significantly better than the source.

I had forgotten the whole Nico and Reyna quest -- I love them and their dynamic. Very fun. I think it's wild how characters that can be so loveable in PJO (Percy and Annabeth) can somehow become so incredibly annoying when they aren't from Percy's first person POV in HOO. Kind of tragic. 
Normally I adore them both. Again: huge s/o to all the fans out there that took some flat characterization and ran with it and made even better shit.

Also, despite all the trash talk, I do like these books and these characters. They are, like the Tortall books, nostalgic for me, although I didn't read HOO until many years after I read Alanna for the first time.

## movies

### Hogfather

I watch this every year (usually with family, this time with friends) as part of my holiday celebrations. I fall asleep pretty much every year before it's over; this year I had the particular indignity of falling asleep while unmuted in a voice chat on discord. 

Great movie. 10/10, will watch again (and again, every year)

### Tick Tick Boom

I didn't have much context for this because I'm not very aware of musicals, despite generally enjoying them. I thought that this was a fun movie, except for the parts that made me cry, which weren't fun, but were good in their own way.
I, like every other person in the world, like Andrew Garfield.

### Encanto

![my real time reactions to encanto](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/149033599-60b3e896-0e4b-452a-abe6-c8c2a9a8b14f.png)

I stand by all of the above. Very nice textiles.

(side note: yes I am aware of the "queer headcanons erasing the main meaning of the story about intergenerational trauma and colonization" discourse that's been happening about this movie; please to not read into my dumbass joke about lesbians I'm glad this movie holds this type of meaning for y'all.
(that said this is a didney movie; it is not actually as anti-colonization as it's pretending to be. don't give money to walt))

### Hilda and the Mountain King

Okay. It's for kids! It doesn't have to be perfect. I like the episodic Hilda better, though.

## tv things

I've been doing a fair amount of handwork recently so I've been watching more TV (normally I don't watch much but it's really good in the background while doing handwork).

### the rest of Wheel of Time season 1

It's fine! I feel the same as I do about all the other eps. 

### Hawkeye (the series)

Okay, so I _loved_ the classic David Aja comics. Pizza dog, all that. I read them in high school and still have the copies I bought then (which, if you know how many times I've moved since then, will mean a lot to you). 
Seeing scenes in the show that were pulled almost directly from the comics made me very happy. (Side note: apparently David Aja hasn't even seen the show, which is wild to me. If I were making a hawkeye show I would have paid good money to get David Aja involved).
I also like Kate and Clint's dynamic and Yelena is (as ever) wonderful. Looking forward to getting more content from Kate and Yelena, for sure.

Disclaimer: I don't pay for MCU content and cannot recommend that you do, either. Didney doesn't need any more cash.

### Discovery of Witches (the series)

I only watched 1.5 episodes or so before stopping -- I read the first book and part of the second a year or so ago and was deeply disappointed. 
They started so promising, but then fell deeply into that horrible "young woman falls deeply in love with man 900 years too old for her and it's super toxic but for some reason portrayed as very romantic" trope. 
I have no patience for it! I DNF'ed ACOTAR for this same reason. It's very sad to be seeing it in Serious Fantasy For Serious Adults!
And it could have been so good, too, with all the time travel and academia and shit. Extremely tragic.
If you have more patience for the mortal/immortal romance trope than I do, you might like this.

For the record, btw, I attempted the show despite knowing that I don't like the books in the hope that the TV adaptation would be changed enough to make it palatable to me. It's a pretty faithful adaptation, so it was not, and I stopped watching.

### Witcher season 2

I skimmed this and only watched Joey Batey's scenes. I don't know what happened but the mouse part was kind of funny.

### Star Trek: Discovery season 4

![disco is .... something](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/149240154-58c21e2b-fc00-4f2c-af61-ecf4170cdd3f.png)

I have a friend who historically been really into this show and so I watch it, too. I've always felt a little eh about it -- I haven't watched a huge amount of Trek, but I prefer the camp of the original series to the flashy intensity of disco.
I've always been confused about how much Faith In The Institution Over All Other Things that the people in this show have, especially after the number of times the institution has failed them. (I enjoyed Michael and Book doing their own thing for a bit.)

This particular season felt particularly disjointed to me. As my friend put it (very well):

![season 4 complaints](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/149240543-df6f41c8-1f9e-4245-b6bf-0eb41aade71a.png)

I wish they had more bridge bonding time -- we watch this for the characters! Give us more character stuff! Anyway this is my proposal:

![big crew dnd game](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/149240728-8fb09409-3624-4d89-91bb-c1e0ff65e625.png)

## Doctor Who season 7 ish

Okay y'all -- I was on Tumblr in 2012. I never watched spn but I was thoroughly invested in a bunch of that other shit: Doctor Who, Sherlock, Merlin, and plenty of other things I would like to own up to even less.
Around 2013 I was becoming more aware of the media I was consuming and became increasingly fed up with Steven Moffatt not letting the women in his stories have literally any purpose, goals, or identity except as defined by a man. 
I stopped watching Sherlock; I sporadically watched Doctor Who through to when Amy and Rory left (midway through season 7). I stopped when Clara joined. 
Not because I hated Clara, but because at that point I was pretty much only watching because I was still fond of Amy and Rory.

Ever since the news about Russell T Davies returning to the show came out, I've been hearing a little more about some of the intervening seasons of the show: most people I know who've kept up with it seem to generally like Capaldi, from what I can tell.
And I've been on a pretty big nostalgia binge (the entire pandemic) so I decided to dive back in.
At first I tried to re-watch some of my favorite episodes from the earlier seasons, but I think I've seen them too many times (even almost a full decade later), and I couldn't get very far into them.
So instead I just started midway through season 7.

I think that this is a really good show to have on in the background while sewing. I don't really have any other strong feelings about it, at this point. It is what it is.

## other stuff?

### wordle

Yeah I'm playing this along with the rest of people on twitter dot com! I like a good lil word game. I'm not very good but I'm not trying to be! It's fun.

### wizard story

I didn't know that people write full ass fiction on (again) twitter dot com. You can read wizard story [here](https://twitter.com/northgalis/status/1324067556504735744) (fair warning: it's pretty long -- took me a few horus to read, probably -- but also incomplete).
I think it's a really interesting idea in terms of format. A story where you can't go back and make edits, and you're making decisions live as you run polls throughout the writing process.
It feels a little similar to publishing a multi-chapter story somewhere like AO3, where you have an audience waiting for new installments and giving you feedback as you post, except on a much more micro scale.
As an art form, I'm intrigued. (I've also been informed that this is something that's been around for a while in places like BTS fic, I just had never encountered it before now.)

That said, I thought this particular story was only okay. Considering the format (again, no editing) it's pretty phenomenal probably, but in the grand scheme of stories not too special to me.
Also, I had been reading the narrator as enby/masc and midway through I saw some fanart that very resolutely decided that they are a woman and that caused a lot of dissonance for me in reading the remaining part of it. 
It seems like most of the fanart has the narrator very womanly like that, despite the source material being extremely vague, which bothers me a bit. That's not the author or story's fault, though.

Very interesting concept! would love to see more things like this! I like experimental internet art/literature!

### switchcraft (mobile game)

I fucking love match 3 games (bejeweled my beloved) and also I like witches! Sometimes I like a mindless mobile game to keep my hands busy while I'm doing something else, so I picked this one. 
I'm on level 955 with 926 of the moon gems or whatever that you pay to play through the story because I geninuely just really like match 3 games and don't really need the story to enjoy the game.
The story is cute, although I wish the only wlw romance option wasn't with a cop.

### marinated eggs

Soft boil some eggs and leave them in the fridge in a bath of soy sauce + rice vinegar + mirin + sesame oil + chili oil. Very good snack all the time. 1000/10

### some things from youtube that I like

When I'm reading sometimes I like to turn on ambiance sounds and/or music, and [this fantasy campfire rpg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84U7IdlYSM) is by far my favorite little mix/edit/thing I've found.

I watch a decent amount of youtube content in my day to day, including a lot of arts and crafts adjacent things. A creator whose videos I've really been enjoying lately (although I discovered them a while ago) is [lemongacha](https://www.youtube.com/c/lemongacha). highly recommend if you like chill ramble-y (but also well edited) art content.

Okay, this roundup is getting pretty out of hand so I'm going to stop there! Here's to another year of writing up my own opinions for only me to see them.
