Hello! On the off chance that you're here solely for the in-English _baji_ pattern drafting tutorial, [click here](#tutorial).
(This post absolutely will have the "here's my tragic life story" before you get to the recipe, but I won't force you to actually read it if you don't want to.)

## the backstory: Daniel Henney as Lan Mandragoran

If you've read any of my [recent](/weblog/2021/12/02/media-roundup.html) [media roundups](/weblog/2021/12/22/media-roundup.html) (which, if you have, truly -- why?? I'm just here to talk to myself),
you'll know that I've been watching the new Wheel of Time series. 
You'll also know that I'm mostly watching it because I have a friend who is really into the books and I enjoy the costume designs. Specifically, I am so enamoured with Lan's costume that this is an actual real interaction that happened while I was providing commentary to my friend while watching episode 7:

![I care more about the costume design than Daniel Henney being hot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147896314-7fd9aac9-28b6-431b-a290-0ed14cbc78ff.png)

(Naive me of almost a week ago did not understand the complexity of this costume yet. We'll get there.)

Anyway, I'm in a little "sewers club" where we meet (virtually) each week to sew things together and share sewing know-how. For our latest project, we decided to each make some simple kind of pajama-ish pants using a pattern of our choice.
I'd been toying with the idea of trying to make parts of Lan's costume for myself (simply because I can) so I thought -- maybe I can do something in that style for my pants sewing project? 
At this point I thought that this would just entail a straightforward drawstring pant (which I already have a pattern for) with perhaps some kind of cuff at the ankle.

Instead of just tracing the pants pattern I had, I spent the next hour or two watching Lan youtube fancams to try and figure out how the hell his clothes work. Here are some of my (Very High Quality) notes:

![notes on Lan (illegible)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147896927-08eb005a-9047-43db-a99f-4495017d130c.png)

For the life of me, I could not figure out how the extra rectangles of fabric on the shoulder connected to the main body of the vest garment.
It was pretty clear that this costume design was in some way East Asian-inspired -- personally I am mostly familiar with traditional Japanese dress, on account of I am Japanese and like learning about my own self, so in order to try and figure out how these shoulders work I was looking into things like _kataginu_ ([something like this](http://www.soi-zen.com/en/articles/arts_martiaux/kataginu)). 
While these do have the some similar structure to Lan's costume, it is not the same and didn't help explain the construction at all in the ways I wanted so I was getting frustrated.

Meanwhile, I was messaging my friend (who was still asleep at this point) just to have someone to witness The Process. Around the time I was reading about _kataginu_, she woke up and said "I think I read somewhere that the costume is inspired by something Korean" which changed everything. I don't know much about Korean dress other than some things like watching [halfsoybean's series on making modern-ish _jeogori_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwoIr0WkQ1Q), so this was very new for me.

In trying to search for Korean clothing rather than Japanese, two things immediately struck me: the first was that it was immediately obvious that Lan's costume was Korean-inspired. The cinched-at-ankle-and-wrist silhouette (to my untrained eye) was much more recognizable in even just my first few searches for _hanbok_ rather than Japanese traditional dress. 
The second thing that struck me: it is much, _much_ harder to find information about Korean clothing than Japanese (while doing searches in English). 

When I've searched for information on Japanese clothing before, I've been frustrated over how much of it is elite-only rather than common folk and how much of any search for historical clothing still comes up with European results, but there are still plenty of sites going through different garments. Searching for Korean dress got me almost nothing.
For a while I was only getting results about a k-drama that featured a few members of BTS. 
After searching for a significant part of this day, I still don't really know what inspired the different parts of Lan's costume: _baji_ for sure (the pants), and maybe _jeogori_ for the base shirt, but I'm not sure about the outermost layer: _jeonbok_, maybe? 
I kept seeing pictures of people who looked like they were wearing very similar clothing to Lan but they were always just pinterest or fan sites with no other information attached to them.

At this point, I wasn't even researching for Lan anymore: I just wanted to know more about _hanbok_. As a result, I circled back to the original inspiration for this rabbit hole: pants. I stumbled across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja9DujaVWSQ) explaining _baji_ construction and was _baffled_. 
It's assembled with straight lines and some kind of triangular looking panel? There's zero fastening built into it? I was so confused how you would even get them on. 
Fortunately, this particular question [was easily answered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPbBga8kWt0). Basically, you do a big kind of fold over pleat and belt them.

Okay, if you're someone who has spoken to me for more than a few hours at some point in the past maybe year or so, you'll have heard my tirade about current American/"western" fashion.
With the exception of like, some baggy styles and some wrap dresses/skirts, very little of the clothing you can easily pick up at a run of the mill retailer in the U.S. is deeply unforgiving of the passage of time.
It's made of plastic that wears out in ways that are difficult to mend and they're cut in styles that can not adapt to any kind of weight fluctuation. Our bodies change! Frequently pants that fit me at 8 am don't fit me by 8 pm! 
This is a mistake and frankly deeply devalues textiles: cloth has gone from something that was incredibly valuable to something that we throw away by the tons. 
Part of this is a result of mechanization, but a lot of it is simply the devaluation of the labor and skill that is required to produce textiles and garments. 
I'll likely write up more on this at some point, as a brief paragraph can't really capture the full breadth of emotion I have about textiles.

All this to say: I'm very invested in finding ways to fasten clothing that are forgiving to body fluctuations. Shirts and things you can mostly just wear baggy, but bottoms are much more difficult. Elastic waistbands wear out too quickly for my taste. 
I'm not fem enough to regularly wear wrap dresses or skirts (which are very good for solving this problem). 
Drawstrings can work alright, but they result in lumpy, uneven gathers. 
I want to find ways of fastening clothing that can still have the clean, business-casual-y lines that I both need for some professional contexts and honestly just enjoy generally but also will fit me as well at the beginning of a pandemic as they do two years later.  _Baji_, I think, do this.

I would be remiss to not mention that many, _many_ other cultures around the world have solutions to this problem, including European ones. 
Until very recently, the value of fabric necessitated strategies that allowed for one garment to be worn much longer (and more frequently) than we tend to wear things these days. 
I've been trying to learn about these different strategies so that I can mimic them in my own current life: learning how _baji_ fasten is just one very exciting iteration of this.

And so of course I decided I wanted to try and make some! The construction is different than anything I've seen before and the fastening strategy is exciting. I want to learn from this, and I learn well by doing.
Plus, I have fabric set aside to make pants this week. May as well make these pants. So, I looked for a pattern.

I could not find a pattern. I searched and searched and searched (during this process, my mom called me, and I couldn't even pretend to hold a conversation because I was so deep in). I just had that one video of assembly.
I'll spare you the details of my searching process, but the short version is that eventually I used google translate to find the Korean term to search for "baji hanbok sewing pattern" and searched directly in Korean.

Because I couldn't find any patterns in American English Google, I've translated the pattern that I found on Korean Google for my own reference and for the reference of any other folks who might be in the same spot and, by some chaotic turn of fate, this site comes up in their searches. That pattern is as follows in the next section.

(FYI: At the end of this post I have included a list of links to sites I came across in my "research" that I think are neat and if you're here you might also think are neat.)

## TUTORIAL 

This is a walkthrough on how to draft a pattern to make your own _baji_. It is pretty much a direct translation of [this](https://blog.naver.com/PostView.nhn?blogId=inkwd&logNo=30182697145), as assisted by google translate and with some clarification from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4apE23LqtU). 
Absolutely full credit to both of these incredible folks for creating this content; all I'm doing here is translating it. 
I also am not going to bother in any way attempting to walk through construction, because [this video covers it very well and with English subtitles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja9DujaVWSQ).

Secondary note: I have not actually made this myself yet. It'll probably be a few weeks before I get around to it, and if I learn anything in the process that might change or clarify any part of this tutorial I will edit it accordingly.

Alright, let's get started.

You will need:

- [your hip measurement](https://www.wikihow.com/Measure-Hips). we'll refer to this as **H** throughout the process.
- the distance between your waist and the floor
- your regular pattern drafting materials like the appropriate rulers and paper

And here is the process. Note that this pattern does _not_ include seam allowance, so you will have to add that yourself.

![step 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147901153-6e2e089c-14ef-429a-aca2-24cf8d9c2b43.png)

1) Draw a vertical line the length of your waist-to-floor-distance measurement. 

![step 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147901283-4fa3df90-38d5-4415-9f97-6bfd2d3d2beb.png)

2) Divide the vertical line into five equal sections.

![step 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147901399-8b4b74ad-6617-4657-8d49-40525382c97c.png)

3) Divide the second-to-top section into four equal sections. 
(Note that the video version of the pattern says that instead of doing steps 2 & 3, you can simply divide the line into three equal sections and do step 4 at the top third. 
The creator of that video says that they've done several different ways and they all come out to around the same as just doing thirds.
The creator of the blog post that I am more directly translating says something that I do not really understand about adjusting where the line is depending on whether you are an adult or a child; it may be that the safest thing to do is just to do thirds.)

![step 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147901498-e11bf30c-7de1-4ded-8bcc-83529a968f12.png)

4) Draw a horizontal line below the third section down -- see the image, this is hard to describe in text. This is perpendicular to your first line; you'll need some kind of square to get the angle correct. 
Make this line **H/2 plus a bit** long. 
The amount that you add should be 1-4 cm (around .5-1.5 in). 2 cm (around .75 in) is probably good unless you need or want extra room in the booty for things a diaper (both of the patterns I'm referencing were originally for toddlers). 

![step 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147901620-a586ddf9-546b-4661-8832-4d8e9c3dcc30.png)

5)  Divide the line from step 4 into 5 equal sections.

![step 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147901685-b6872e96-0380-4a6e-a33e-7097d20e7311.png)

6)  Draw a horizontal line at the top of your initial vertical line. This line is **H/4 + a bit** long. 
It seems to me, based on the commentary in both sources, that adding around 3 cm (just over 1 inch) is good for a child and 5 cm (2 inches) is good for adults.

![step 7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147901776-dfcf96bf-41f2-48ac-9bbb-32006c72fbe3.png)

7)  Draw a horizontal line at the bottom of your initial vertical line. This line is **H/4 + a bit** long (as well).
The "a bit" for this is less than the "a bit" from step 6. This will be at your ankle; the directions suggest between 0 and 3 cm (0-1.5 in). 
I think you should select this based on how wide you want the ankles to be.

![step 8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147901819-0fd506ee-64b4-4b94-852a-bbde439706c6.png)

8)  Draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom, crossing through the left 2/5 mark in the middle line (see the diagram, this is difficult to describe). This line should be exactly parallel to the first vertical line, so do what you need to to make that happen.

![step 9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147901869-7914dc26-8053-463e-9e96-751d0b058580.png)

9)  Draw a diagonal line from the right end of the top line to the right end of the middle horizontal line. 
(Note: the video version does this part slightly differently; it draws a new point 3 cm left of the rightmost point on the middle line and draws the diagonal line to that, instead. Up to you which you decide to do.)

![step 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147901934-07744e59-4285-44c2-b06c-a920a6254e36.png)

10) Draw a diagonal line from the right end of the bottom line to the right end of the middle horizontal line. (The same note applies here as in step 9.)

![step 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147902089-0ad0e637-8f5c-461d-9012-77ef2bb1d61b.png)

11) Copy the entire right section (from the right vertical line and on), mirror it, and rotate it. (See the diagram.) Probably the easiest way to do this is to take a second sheet of paper and trace the shape of that section onto it to use as a template to trace the mirrored version.

![step 12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147902162-df76675a-9e1b-43f1-b5fe-5e799161710e.png)

12) Draw a line from the topmost corner of the new, rotated shape to its counterpart in the original shape.

![step 13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147902344-1966e93a-734a-4cf7-9b81-e814bdc0e561.png)

13) Draw a curve between the line from step 12 and the two lines below it. Based on the video, you should split the diagonal line in the middle of that triangle in two and draw the curve through that central point.

![step 14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147902566-de6c62eb-ae0d-4a1a-bea6-e5eb6415d976.png)

14) Measure 4 cm (1.5 in) down the "leg" of the mirrored shape and draw a vertical line through that point. If you're making this for a toddler and not an adult, use 1 cm (.5 in) instead.
(Note: if you opted in steps 9 and 10 to use the video's method, where you marked a new point 3 cm in on the middle line, you will just use the original rightmost endpoint to mark the vertical line. You don't need to make a new mark.)

![step 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147902682-1894832f-b5e8-4cce-8eef-b6e6f474890f.png)

15) You will need a belt, waistband, and ankle strips: you will measure the length of the waistband based on the circumference of the waist on the garment as you assemble the _baji_, but the width should be up to 15 cm (6 in) for adults and 9 cm (3.5 in) for children. 
(I forgot to include the waistband in the image; please just imagine that it's there.)
I honestly have no idea how wide the belt or ankle strips are supposed to be, so I'd just eyeball it.

![final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147902926-0da45379-c3cf-4c18-a8d9-496fcdf3c1c4.png)

16) That's it! Here are the final pieces. You'll need two of each piece, with the rectangle panel cut on the fold.
Further directions for assembly can be found in the [video I linked earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja9DujaVWSQ).
Note that, in those assembly instructions, they did not draw the curve in step 13. You won't have to trim off as much excess as they do as a result.
