One thing I've learned over the past 651 days of quarantine (some times more quarantine-y than others) is that putting effort into feeding myself makes a world of difference in my mental health.
I actually really love cooking -- I was raised in a household where everybody pitched in sometimes in the kitchen, so it was a given when I grew up and moved out that I'd be doing this for myself (the idea that people make it through adulthood without being able to cook more than a grilled cheese is kind of inconceivable to me). 
Cooking is a creative outlet when its at its best and just a fun sensory experience at its worst; cooking for myself is deeply low-stakes because there's no one to impress and I'll eat pretty much anything (even if it's bad).

Earlier this year I discovered the [Redwall feasts bot](https://twitter.com/redwallfeasts) on Twitter. I never read much of the Redwall books as a kid, even though my brother was really into them, because I thought they were a little boring. As an adult, I still think they're a little boring, but I adore the tenderness with which Jacques writes about food.
Even the simplest meal is celebrated and appreciated; the origins and makers of each food item are equally important.
Cooking for someone is an act of love, and eating together is what defines a community. 

The food I eat is almost entirely food I cook for myself. I don't like buying ready-made or freezer meals (I think they're unnecessarily expensive and I don't own a microwave) and I don't like ordering takeout (also expensive, a hassle, and Uber Eats is deeply unethical).
I'm not going to restaurants in the middle of a continuing pandemic. 
When I'm feeling gloomy or tired or otherwise just a little done with the world, feeding myself becomes a chore -- and a difficult one, at that.
I hate washing dishes and cooking always results in a multidude of little messes. 
The solution: LARPing as a Redwall mouse! Redwall abbey mice would never shy away from preparing a meal, because every meal is an act of love and tenderness.
What I'm saying is really that thinking about how Brian Jacques writes about food in Redwall helps me think of cooking as an act of self-care and joy, rather than just a necessary chore for survival. 
This is absolutely silly and sentimental, but by god does it help me.

Anyway, all this to say: I want to talk about food.

One of my friends provided me with a [new recipe for sprouts](/recipes/2021/12/22/alt-sprouts.html) recently. I'd been bored with my [previous sprouts recipe](/recipes/2021/11/17/brussels-sprout.html) and wanted something new. I just wrote up that recipe so it covers a lot of this but: I've really been enjoying this process. 
To be frank, it's kind of fundamentally an avocado toast process: I've been buying avocados recently for the first time in years and making toast with avocado or brussel sprout shreds and egg and mustard feels so wholesome and filling and flavorful; all the textures are right. 
I don't know why, but it also feels easier to clean up from than a lot of foods I make: it requires a pot, at least two mugs (I don't have any small bowls), at least one cast iron, and several utensils. Maybe it's because there's so much down time built into waiting for the egg to boil?
That's the perfect time to wash a dish or two.
Anyway, I think I've made some variation on this almost every day for the past few weeks. It's best with a little fruit on the side: it's winter, so I'd go with a mandarin or a persimmon.

![a very good breakfast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/147168867-8488d692-1909-4ce7-a8d6-0389ce211c15.png)

I've been strictly isolating (no going outside -- living in an apartment building means everything beyond my door is public space) for a few days now due to a potential covid exposure, and will likely need to continue to do so for at least a few more days while waiting for test results.
(If my test is negative, I'll be free to go, but the results are very delayed. If it's positive, I'm asymptomatic, so I'll have to isolate for 10 days as per CDC guidelines.)
I have enough food for two weeks or so I think, and I can always get grocery delivery. This does mean though that I'm getting short on fresh things (especially because this was an unexpected thing, so I hadn't stocked up beforehand).
So no fresh mandarins alongside my breakfast. Tonight I am making lentils (dry lentils are a good shelf-stable pantry item for unexpected isolation) and I suspect I'll make some dry beans in the next few days.

I'm also being inspired to actually use up some of the things that have been in the back of my fridge or cupboards instead of going out and buying something new. 
A few weeks ago, some friends and I gathered on a rooftop with a firepit (the kind you get a new development high rise -- a gas thing with glass walls and fake rocks) and I drank mulled wine for the first time.
I don't drink much in general and I've never been a fan of wine but this was delicious, and I've been wanting to try and replicate it but maybe with enough boiling to take away the brunt of the alcohol part. But, I don't typically have wine lying around.
So, instead of waiting until I can go outside again to go buy wine to mull, I turned to the half bottle of sour cherry juice I've had in my fridge for a month leftover from [making cranberry sauce](/recipes/2021/12/22/cranberry-sauce.html), watered it down a little, and mulled that with a cinnamon stick and star anise and cloves and peppercorns and the rest of an old bottle of honey that crystalized.
I wish I'd had some orange peel -- I think that the bitterness from it would have complimented the cherry well. It's a rich drink but it's nice to have something hot and strong sometimes.

... This was going to be a longer post but this is where my train of thought ended. consider it a holiday special. io saturnalia! (fyi, thankfully my PCR test did come back negative)
