## movies

### emma (2020)

I didn't like this movie! sorry for starting this media roundup on a negative but unfortunately it is true. I'm very familiar with and invested in the source material and I feel extremely strongly that Clueless (1995) is the best adaptation of Emma that exists and will probably ever exist. 
I did like how in this version they're very overt about the constant presence of servants -- however, I feel like Emma should both be someone who is annoying and someone who, fundamentally, you want to _be_. 
She's supposed to be legitimately well-liked among her friends and community and you as a reader should both resent her perfect life and envy it. In this version, I hated her completely. I really wanted to turn the whole thing off pretty early on; I don't think there's anything wrong with an over-the-top style or any problems with making it a little cheeky, but making all the characters that unlikeable is pretty unforgiveable. They're supposed to be annoying but not, like, unbearable. (Cher in Clueless is the perfect balance of all of these things.)

### the lord of the rings (early 2000's); extended editions + cast commentary

I grew up on these! Including the cast commentary. Yes, I do own a DVD player exclusively for the ability to watch these movies with the special features. Watching them is a good Thanksgiving weekend activity.

It's interesting re-visiting these, though. They age pretty well -- the special effects, for example, are still fucking incredible. The models they made for the locations are legitimate works of art. I'd forgotten about the humor in these: Gimli being basically only comic relief, Legolas skateboarding, Merry and Pippin being dumbasses. I find myself enjoying that less than I used to. 
I kind of want the humorlessness of something like Dune, now, although I think Merry and Pippin's foolishness feels more appropriate and organic than, for example, Gimli and Legolas having a drinking contest.
I think also the white, male-dominated cast feels less appropriate now that it did then (perhaps only because I am older now and understand more of the world) -- it's strange listening to the commentary and hearing them talk about how it was a "boys club" and things like that. Some of the jokes they crack in the commentary probably would have gotten cut in a 2021 edit, too. Things about getting elves pregnant and things like that.

I really want a pair of boots like Saruman's. Maybe not in white, though.

## books!

### the merciful crow + its sequel (a duology by margaret owen)

I mentioned this in my last roundup but have since finished both the first book and its sequel. I was very glad to learn that it was a duology and not a trilogy: I find in trilogies it's very rare to have a second book that isn't pretty trash. The second book in this one starts off feeling a little artificial, a little retconned, but ultimately I enjoyed the way the stakes were raised in the second book compared with the first.
I think the romance is by far the weakest part of this story. It happens a little too hard a little too fast (as in most YA) and frankly it just isn't very interesting to me. But, unlike a lot of YA, it isn't like deeply toxic, so it gets a pass. Anyway: pretty good fun all around.

### how to do nothing (jenny odell)

I don't read too much non-fiction and almost never books that lean toward "lifestyle" or "self-help", but this particular book was highly recommended to me, so I gave it a shot. In some ways it felt like a lot of validation of things I have learned for myself: 
things like stepping away from social media, celebrating non-centralized, non-corporate internet presence (like this) and spending time in nature or around other people where I just sit and observe (I have been known to just watch a pond or wander from tree to tree for extended amounts of time). 
I do think that the perspective of this particular book regarding the role of attention in activism is very centered around coming from a place of privilege: it doesn't really feel like it acknowledges the value that digital communities and digital spaces can have when physical spaces are so frequently unsafe. I generally enjoyed it, but don't know that I got too much out of it beyond feeling somewhat validated in some of the decisions I've made. 

### cemetary boys (aiden thomas)

A very sweet book that is doing some great things! It's not flawless in terms of narrative structure, but it's worth it. I will be removing the dust jacket and Trojan Horse-ing it in a box of other various books and giving it to my cousins that live in rural Utah.

### mythos (stephen fry)

I've been picking away at this collection of myths for probably like a year now? It's pretty fun; I find that Stephen Fry has a very distinctive voice that lends itself well to this kind of storytelling. I feel like I can hear him speaking it out to me, telling me the tale, as I'm reading, which is quite nice.

## tv

### wheel of time (2021)

I've only watched the first three episodes thus far, and mostly because I have a friend who is really, really into the books. 
Personally I will never read them because the kind of gender essentialism that the world is based on is even more painful for me than just "this story is only about men". 
However, I really enjoy the costume design in the show so I'll probably keep watching it on and off. 

Here is some of my commentary from watching the first three episodes, in the form of texts to my friend:

## games 

### hades

Okay, no one should be surprised by this at this point probably but: Hades is a fucking incredible game. I don't game much and never something that's as fighting-heavy as this, but I have 80+ hours in Hades. 
I have been playing in God Mode because I'm pretty Bat At Video Games -- it still took me probably 40 or so runs to escape -- but I love it so much. I love that they have that option for people who are Bad At Video Games, and I love the way that the "gameplay" part integrates into the various narratives. Even after finishing the main story, your progression is still dependent on doing runs: you need to have encounters in the depths to progress so you still are rewarded for both success and failure. 

I love all of the characters so deeply -- every time I stop playing for a bit I come back to it and I'm reminded why I love the game so much when I have a conversation with Hades or with Orpheus or with Achilles or whoever and it hits me real deep and I have to stop to feel my feelings for a moment. Also I love Chaos SO much.
Great shit overall. I love the art, I love the music. I love how the gameplay is flexible and novel and never gets stale even when you're just doing the same thing over and over. 

absolutely 10/10. play hades!

### cats and soup

This is a cookie clicker kinda mobile game that clearly exists just for ad farming. I have an adblock on my phone so I am not successfully farmed for ad viewage, which means I have to wait longer to get things than most players. 
Honestly, I wouldn't usually play this kind of thing but a friend recommended it, and the little animations are very smooth. Also, I found my own cat, and she's pretty cute:

## music

### it's spotify wrapped season

![my top genres are a nightmare](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91703680/144528544-b03b1057-401d-4fa8-bc4a-939b9d36f9d4.png)

dream smp >??????? DREaM SMP ??????!?!??!?????????!!??!!?

Apparently Spotify tags anything made by an artist that's like a "I'm famous from the Internet" person as Dream SMP. Which is fucking horrifying in so many ways but does explain how I got this here: I do really enjoy a few artists like [Penelope Scott](https://youtu.be/LpxT9TLGoLI) who I discovered from places like Tiktok.

(yes shanty is legitimately my top genre)

## okay that's it for now

take care!
