two posts back to back ... this is what I get for putting things off until I have some free time

## movies

### Dune (2021)

Watching Dune made me feel like I was ten and watching the Lord of the Rings movies again for the first time: kind of confused but absolutely transported. A feeling that I've been granted a rare window into a special kind of experience. I watched it twice in two days.

I don't like how many of the actors I recognize. Timothee Chalamet is confusing to me. I like Oscar Isaac, though.

### Shang-Chi (2021)

Super fun! Didn't really feel like a Marvel movie, which my coworkers say is because it emulates a Hong Kong kung fu movie. I haven't seen any of those so I can't really say whether or not that's the case. It made me homesick for California. 

Highly recommend [the Twitter thread where the San Fransico bus driver reviews the bus scene](https://twitter.com/that_mc/status/1459613123590066180).

### No Time To Die (2021)

The only Bond movies I've seen are the ones that have Ben Whishaw in them. I wish my hair did the things that his hair does, and that me being a naive young nerd wearing grandpa clothes and having a cat was as charming for me as it is for Ben Whishaw's Q. I fell asleep midway through this movie, but I was pretty tired. 

I also think I watched Spectre during this time period I'm rounding-up, but I don't have anything to say about it that I haven't said here.

### Wonder Woman (2017) 

Okay? Gal Gadot is very cool I think. I was having fun watching it but also I fell asleep before it was over and didn't come back to it. (I fall asleep during movies a lot.)

## tv

### GBBO (this year's season)

I would like to become Jurgen: I want to have the impeccable energy of an older man who seems just a little like a wizard but in a humble way. I legitimately love pretty much all of the bakers this year, so it's been hard watching them dwindle: I'm about to watch the semi-final and nervous for the final. I think I would be okay with any of them winning, which is a good place to be. 
That said, I will also be sad if (when) any of them lose.

### QI (older seasons)

I've been playing more QI in the background while doing dishes and things like that recently -- I watched a lot of re-uploaded Stephen Fry clips from it as a teen and have listened regularly to the No Such Thing As A Fish podcast as an adult, but haven't actually watched much of Sandi's material until now.
I think QI is ... not perfect, obviously, but it's kind of comfort content for me: it has a particular nostalgia to it and the combination of "dumbass British humor" and "dumbass facts no one cares about" makes me happy.

### Arcane (2021)

I unironically and somewhat embarrassingly LOVE this. The animation is weird but so good and they use it so well to communicate things that live action couldn't (Jinx's whole deal !!! incredible). I know absolutely jack shit about League of Legends but this show is somehow deeply heartrending. It's also weirdly gay? whatever Cait and Vi have going on is _not_ straight. Really looking forward to watching the third batch of episodes this weekend.

## books

### the fire never goes out (N.D. Stevenson)

I've been following ND's work for a long, long time now (since the broship of the rings, I'm pretty sure), and his memoirs always strike true for me. I've been following his substack recently so going back and reading _the fire never goes out_ was interesting -- it hints at some of the stuff he's been discussing on substack but doesn't address it directly. Anyway, great art and great storytelling as always.

### The Merciful Crow (Margaret Owen)

Okay, I haven't actually finished this yet -- I wanted a nice, low brainpower fantasy audiobook to listen to while sitting on the metro and it's done nicely. I think it's pretty fun! The high concept world is interesting (I also am just a big fan of birds) and the characters feel pretty real. 
Also, and I know this is a low bar, but so much YA/NA I read these days I can't finish because there's so much "this romance between a 15 year old and a 30000 year old is fated and also good and not toxic at all" and I actually really like Fie: she's not deeply infuriating like some of these heroines (looking at you, A Court of Thorns and Roses). 
I'll might recommend it to my friend who likes this kind of genre when I'm done, assuming the last third isn't way worse than the first two.

## food

### pomegranate molasses

I think pomegranate molasses might be my soulmate? it's so deep and tart and fundamentally sweet in a way -- I am in love. I haven't really figured out how to cook with it yet but I'm learning! It reminds me a bit of chamoy, but more versatile.

### eggs (poached and soft-boiled)

I've always fried or over-medium'ed my eggs but it frequently ends in disaster: I love a runny yolk and nothing else about an egg, so if I don't have a runny yolk I get sad. Recently I tried poaching an egg for the first time and that went _shockingly_ well, but THEN I tried soft-boiling and that went even better. I think it'll be my go-to, now. 
I love a rice bowl with whatever veg I need to use up (I'm thinking the end of a bag of kale or some green beans or brussels sprouts), some soft boiled eggs, pickled ginger, and a little mayo and tonkatsu sauce.

### Hungarian paprika mushroom soup

Okay, I had some mushrooms to use up once and stumbled across [this recipe](https://themodernproper.com/hungarian-mushroom-soup) and I really love it (I went out and bought both Hungarian paprika and dried dill for it). I've been making a smaller batch version (because I am just one person), using oat milk instead of cream and forgoing onions on account of the continued salmonella-related onion recalls scaring me out of buying any kind of onion.
It's still great! I love mushrooms. I've been making a lot of miso soups with mushrooms in for breakfasts, too. A great way to begin a day as the season changes.
